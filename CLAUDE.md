# DOOM-COBOL Integration Status

## Current State (2025-06-27)

### What Just Happened
- User was trying to control DOOM via COBOL commands but nothing was happening in the game
- Fixed multiple issues:
  1. Docker container couldn't access Mac display (was using virtual display :99)
  2. Bug in direct_doom.py: used 'release' instead of 'keyUp' for keyboard actions
  3. macOS accessibility permissions needed for pyautogui

### Fixes Applied
1. Fixed direct_doom.py key release actions (changed 'release' to 'keyUp')
2. Created local runner scripts to bypass Docker display issues
3. User just enabled accessibility permissions for iTerm

### Current Setup
- Docker containers have been stopped
- System ready to run locally with pyautogui
- Accessibility permissions granted to iTerm

### Next Steps
1. User may need to restart iTerm for accessibility permissions to take effect
2. Run the system locally:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start DOOM
   chocolate-doom -window
   
   # Terminal 2: Start local COBOL interface
   ./run_local_cobol.sh
   
   # Terminal 3: Send commands
   echo "MOVE FORWARD 2" | nc localhost 9999
   ```

### Key Files
- `fix_doom_control.sh` - Setup script that installs dependencies and guides through permissions
- `run_local_cobol.sh` - Runs COBOL interface locally (port 9999)
- `test_doom_control.py` - Direct test of pyautogui control
- `cobol-interface/direct_doom.py` - Fixed controller (was using wrong key actions)

### Architecture Notes
- System works by accepting COBOL-style commands on port 9999
- Commands are translated to keyboard/mouse actions via pyautogui
- Docker version doesn't work on macOS due to display access limitations
- Must run locally for pyautogui to control the actual DOOM window

### Testing
If pyautogui still doesn't work after iTerm restart:
1. Test with: `python3 test_doom_control.py`
2. Check if Terminal.app also needs permissions
3. Verify DOOM is in windowed mode and focused
