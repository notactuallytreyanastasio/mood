# DOOM-COBOL Current State

## What's Working Now

You have successfully dockerized the DOOM-COBOL interface! Here's what's currently running:

### 1. COBOL Command Interface (Port 9999)
A TCP server that accepts high-level DOOM commands and converts them to COBOL-style records.

**Test it:**
```bash
echo "MOVE FORWARD" | nc localhost 9999
echo "TURN RIGHT 90" | nc localhost 9999
echo "SHOOT" | nc localhost 9999
```

### 2. Web UI (Port 8080)
A dashboard for monitoring and controlling DOOM.

**Access it:**
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Current Architecture

```

## What's Not Yet Connected

1. **Mainframe Emulator** - The z/OS environment to run actual COBOL
2. **Bridge Service** - The component that reads DOOM memory
3. **DOOM Process** - The actual game

## Quick Commands

### Start Everything
```bash
make -f Makefile.simple up-simple
```

### Stop Everything
```bash
make -f Makefile.simple down-simple
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs doom-cobol-interface -f
docker logs doom-web-ui -f
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Without Mainframe (Mock Mode)
The COBOL interface currently tries to connect to a mainframe that doesn't exist. You could modify it to work in mock mode for testing.

### Option 2: Add Mainframe Emulator
Use the full docker-compose.yml to add Hercules MVS emulator:
```bash
make up  # This will fail until we fix the mainframe image
```

### Option 3: Direct DOOM Control
Skip the mainframe entirely and have the COBOL interface directly control DOOM using pyautogui.

## The Commands You Can Send

When everything is connected, these commands will control DOOM:

```bash
# Movement
echo "MOVE FORWARD 2" | nc localhost 9999    # Move forward for 2 seconds
echo "MOVE BACK 1" | nc localhost 9999       # Move backward for 1 second
echo "MOVE LEFT" | nc localhost 9999         # Strafe left (default 0.5s)
echo "MOVE RIGHT" | nc localhost 9999        # Strafe right

# Combat  
echo "TURN LEFT 45" | nc localhost 9999      # Turn left 45 degrees
echo "TURN RIGHT 90" | nc localhost 9999     # Turn right 90 degrees
echo "SHOOT" | nc localhost 9999             # Fire weapon once
echo "SHOOT 3" | nc localhost 9999           # Fire 3 times

# Interaction
echo "USE" | nc localhost 9999               # Open doors, activate switches

# Weapons
echo "WEAPON 1" | nc localhost 9999          # Switch to fist
echo "WEAPON 2" | nc localhost 9999          # Switch to pistol
echo "WEAPON 3" | nc localhost 9999          # Switch to shotgun
```

## Current Status

✅ Dockerized COBOL command interface
✅ Web UI for monitoring
✅ Command parsing and translation
✅ Clean architecture for expansion

❌ Mainframe connection (needs Hercules setup)
❌ DOOM process integration (needs bridge service)
❌ Actual COBOL programs running on MVS

## The Vision

Eventually, when you send "SHOOT", this happens:
1. TCP command → COBOL Interface (✅ Working)
2. Convert to EBCDIC → MVS Dataset (❌ Needs mainframe)
3. JCL job reads command → COBOL program analyzes (❌ Needs mainframe)
4. COBOL decides tactics → Output commands (❌ Needs mainframe)
5. Bridge reads commands → Send to DOOM (❌ Needs bridge)
6. DOOM responds! (❌ Needs DOOM running)

You're about 40% of the way there!
